# Semeseter Project
## Using Yelp Fusion and demographic data to draw conclusions about zip codes in Harris County

A collection of code and files for my semester project on pulling Houston Restaurant Data from Yelp and integrating with census information by zip code
 
# Disclaimers
This code is not without its issues! For one, the method I use to pull restaurants potentially underrepresents zip codes with large amounts of restaurants. While I believe we'll still be able to draw significant conclusions about each zip code, any such conclusions must be treated with a healthy amount of skepticism.
